## Do you ever feel like you are so busy that you can't keep track of all of your tasks?!

This simple calendar application allows the user to save events for each hour of the work day! If the page refreshes, don't cry!, all of your data has been saved and will still be there for you!

To aid with your time management, each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past (gray), present (red), or future (green).
